# Typescript Express Server ðŸ’»
This project is a simple Express server that is written in TypeScript. It takes advantage of TypeScript's features, such as classes, typed variables, and decorators, to create a more robust and maintainable server.

The server has a couple of simple routes:
* `/protected`: This route demonstrates the usage of a guard to restrict access 
* `/login`: This route allows the user to login (fake data on session)
* `/logout`: This route allows the user to logout (clear session) 

**To run the server, you can use the following command:**
`npm start`

You can then access the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Benefits of using TypeScript:**
* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
* TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, which can help to prevent errors.
* TypeScript can help to improve the readability and maintainability of JavaScript code.

**Benefits of using Express:**
* Express is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
* Express is simple to use and has a large community of users.
* Express provides a number of features that make it easy to build web applications, such as routing, middleware, and templating.

**Benefits of using classes and typed variables:**
* Classes can help to organize code and make it more reusable.
* Typed variables can help to prevent errors and make code more readable and maintainable.

**Benefits of using decorators:**
* Decorators can be used to add additional functionality to classes and methods.
* Decorators can be used to validate input, log events, and perform other tasks.
